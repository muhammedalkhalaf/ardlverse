Description: A unified framework for Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) modeling 
    and cointegration analysis. Implements Panel ARDL with Pooled Mean Group (PMG), 
    Mean Group (MG), and Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE) estimators following 
    Pesaran, Shin & Smith (1999). Provides bootstrap-based bounds testing for 
    small samples, Quantile Nonlinear ARDL (QNARDL) combining distributional and 
    asymmetric effects, and Fourier ARDL for modeling smooth structural breaks. 
    All methods include comprehensive diagnostics, publication-ready outputs, 
    and visualization tools.
